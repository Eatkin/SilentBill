# Silent Bill

*The worst looking point and click horror you'll ever see*

## About the Game

### The Story

The evil ducks have trapped you in a beach hut, you must find a way to escape before they kill you!

### About the Development

Silent Bill was made in 7 days for the "I can't draw but want to make a game (again)" jam. This is a poorly drawn and sarcastic escape room style point and click where you have to find your way out without being killed by a duck.

Silent Bill has since been fully remade from the ground up into a much better game (but still with deliberately bad graphics). [Play Silent Bill 2022 here!](https://eatkin.itch.io/silent-bill)

### How to Play

- Click things to interact
- Hold space to see what you can interact with
- Hold escape to quit (desktop builds)

### Additional information

#### Mobile users

The game may be scaled by non-integer values to fill the screen, so may not be pixel perfect. This may make some graphics and text slightly less clear.

#### Jump scares

This game has jump scares (they're not really very scary) but they are optional! You can turn them off to be replaced by amusing situations, such as a door-to-door sales duck trying to sell you a vacuum cleaner.

#### Additional content

Bonus content includes a 13 page booklet with a detailed walkthrough, developer commentary and some bonus content including unused assets and interesting trivia. Also includes the Gamemaker Studio 2 project file.
